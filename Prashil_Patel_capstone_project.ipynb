    "# 1. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aim:\n",
    "To explore and analyze game reviews by extracting sentiment scores and identifying key terms using sentiment analysis and Bag of Words techniques, ultimately developing a model that accurately predicts sentiment and highlights the most influential words in each review.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pitch:\n",
    "Understanding the sentiment behind user reviews can guide potential players in deciding which games are worth their time and money. Additionally, by identifying sentiment-rich keywords, game developers and publishers can gain actionable insights into player feedback. This project leverages a large-scale dataset of game reviews to build a sentiment classification model and extract trend-based insights that support both consumer decisions and development strategies.\n",

    "#### Results and findings:\n",
    "- Using Vader (before seperation):\n",
    "    - 84.4% Reviews are positive\n",
    "    - 14.4% Reviews are negative\n",
    "    - 1.3% Reviews are neutral\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using Vader (after seperation):\n",
    "    - 66.4% Reviews are positive\n",
    "    - 21.9% Reviews are negative\n",
    "    - 11.7% Reviews are neutral\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Baseline Model:\n",
    "- Logistic Regression:\n",
    "    - Logistic regression performs fairly well across all vectorisers with the highest accuracy at count vectors with 74%\n",
    "    - Wordlevel TF-IDF and Charlevel vectors have comparable performance around 70% while N-gram vectors is the lowest performing at 58.6%\n",
    "- Naive Bayes:\n",
    "    - Naive Bayes generally performs lower compared to logistic regression and SVM, with the highest being 60.6% with count vectors.\n",
    "    - Wordlevel TF-IDF, N-gram vectors and CharLevel vectors all perform similarly\n",
    "- Support Vector Machine\n",
    "    - SVM performs fairly well with its best accuracy with WordLevel TF-IDf at 74%, while just lower than that performance is CharLevel and count Vectors at 73%\n",
    "    - The worst performing vectoriser is N-gram vectors at 64% while Count Vectors at 72% is still plausible.\n",
    "- Overall:\n",
    "    - SVM seems to be the best performing model out of the 3 with Logistic Regression being just behind it. \n",
    "    - Although SVM is better performing, it is also important to note Logistic Regression gives the simplist and interpretable model.\n",
    "    - The Naive bayes model needs to be adjusted with other feature engineering methods or the hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "    - N-gram vectorizer underperformed across all models, suggesting a need to test other n-gram ranges (e.g., (1,2) instead of (2,4)) or consider using fewer rare n-grams.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tuned Model:\n",
    "- Logistic Regression:\n",
    "    - Logistic regression performs fairly well across all vectorisers with the highest accuracy at WordLevel TF-IDF with 75%\n",
    "    - Count vectors, wordlevel TF-IDF and Charlevel vectors all have comparable performance around 74% while N-gram vectors is the lowest performing at 65.5\n",
    "- Naive Bayes:\n",
    "    - Naive Bayes generally performs lower compared to logistic regression and SVM, with the highest being 70.3% with CharLevel vectors.\n",
    "    - Wordlevel TF-IDF, N-gram vectors and CharLevel vectors all perform similarly\n",
    "- Support Vector Machine\n",
    "    - SVM performs fairly well with its best accuracy with WordLevel TF-IDf at 75%, while just lower than that performance is CharLevel Vectors at 74%\n",
    "    - The worst performing vectoriser is N-gram vectors at 66% while Count Vectors at 72% is still plausible.\n",
    "- Overall:\n",
    "    - SVM seems to be the best performing model out of the 3 with Logistic Regression being just behind it. \n",
    "    - Although SVM is better performing, it is also important to note Logistic Regression gives the simplist and interpretable model.\n",
    "    - The Naive bayes model needs to be adjusted with other feature engineering methods or the hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "    - N-gram vectors has performed poorly across the board so potentially needs to be tested with new n-gram ranges\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Comparison:\n",
    "- Logistic Regression:\n",
    "    - Count Vectors preformed about the same before and after tuning\n",
    "    - All other vectorisers performed better after tuning\n",
    "    - Best performing vectoriser is WordLevel TF-IDF after tuning\n",
    "- Naive Bayes\n",
    "    - Has performed better over every vectoriser after tuning\n",
    "    - Improved the most after tuning in comparsion to Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine\n",
    "    - Best performing vectoriser is CharLevel Vectors after tuning\n",
    "- Support Vector Machine\n",
    "    - Minimal difference from before and after tuning\n",
    "    - All vectorisers perform around the same except for N-gram vectors.\n",
    "    - Best performing vectoriser WordLevel TF-IDF\n",
    "- Overall:\n",
    "    - Hyperparameter Tuning has improved the results in every model.\n",
    "        - Most improvements are with Naive Bayes model.\n",
    "    - N-Gram vectors is still an underperforming vectoriser.\n",
    "    - The best performing model is Logitistic Regression with WordLevel TF-IDF at 74.98%, while just behind it is the same vectoriser with Support vector machine at 74.96%.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "- The best-performing model was Logistic Regression with Word-Level TF-IDF vectorizer, with SVM using the same vectorizer close behind—making it a strong alternative.\n",
    "- After fitting the best model, I was able to identify key words that influenced the sentiment of individual reviews, providing valuable insights for both developers and users.\n",
    "- Hyperparameter tuning significantly improved performance, suggesting that further optimization could yield even better results.\n",
    "- With a final F1-score of 74.98%, the model meets the project’s goal for acceptable performance in sentiment classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenges\n",
    "- Cleaning the dataset, very messy\n",
    "- Dataset was small so need more data (more titles to work with)\n",
    "- Reviews come in different languages so to deploy to a different region could result in more issues\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future Improvements or considerations\n",
    "- Deploy a model which can take a review and produce the results\n",
    "- Improve f1-score with more hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "- More data\n",
    "- Using deep learning or transformer-based models.\n"

On Mars, the Union Aerospace Corporation has established a radioactive waste facility and allowed the military to conduct teleportation experiments on the nearby moons of Deimos and Phobos. Hours ago, the base on Mars began receiving incoherent distress messages from Phobos, while Deimos has disappeared completely. With all attempts to establish contact failing, you and your team have been dispatched to investigate. Upon arrival, you secure the perimeter as the rest of your team enters the facility. As you stand guard, your radio crackles with the sound of gunfire, cracking bones and blood-curdling screams and eventually falls silent. Alone, with no way off the planet or means to defend yourself other than your trusty pistol, there’s only one way out - into the complex of death and the horrors that await you within. If you plan to get out of here alive you must fend off the hordes of demonic imps, haunting spectres and your undead, former comrades waiting to tear you limb from limb.

Broken into three to four acts, the game also has a strong focus on story-telling and boast tons of magic spells and abilities. Described as \"Clash of the Titans meets Heavy Metal\", God of War equips its hero with a pair of sword-like chain weapons that can grab enemies, perform multi-hit combos, and pull off a variety of different aerial attacks. Slight platforming elements and an energy collection system similar to that of Onimusha have been incorporated as well, and players are even able to use certain elements of their fallen enemies as a weapon (re: Medusa's head, for instance, can be used to turn enemies to stone after you've defeated her).",

However, I cannot say that Persona 5 is a bad game, although my experience with it was a bit rough. I had this state of waiting for something, like 5-10 hours more, and something incredible would happen for sure, characters pull off some weird moves and the real Persona (the one everyone is so hyped up about) would begin... Never happened. Might finish it sometime later tho, whenever vibes come back.\"]",

Don't get me wrong, it's a great game, but with REmake, RE3 and Code Veronica it was for me the weakest in the classic style saga. Then came this game in 2019. Holy fuck. Not only was this the first RE game I played on launch, but it just blew me away with how polished it was. The police station feels more real than ever, with dark and immersive areas that make you feel trapped and scared. The graphics also contribute to this, being incredibly realistic yet stylized, even if spme faces look a bit weird. I complained about how in the original RE playing as both characters wasn't worth it because the story barely changed, but that's completely fixed here. Not only do each of them have compelling and really different stories, but they also have different accessible rooms, gameplay segments and even final bosses. Another recurring problem with this franchise is that the best area is always the first one, and although that's also the case here, both the sewers and the lab are really fun and memorable in their own way.

However, I cannot say that Persona 5 is a bad game, although my experience with it was a bit rough. I had this state of waiting for something, like 5-10 hours more, and something incredible would happen for sure, characters pull off some weird moves and the real Persona (the one everyone is so hyped up about) would begin...

Not only was this the first RE game I played on launch, but it just blew me away with how polished it was. The police station feels more real than ever, with dark and immersive areas that make you feel trapped and scared. The graphics also contribute to this, being incredibly realistic yet stylized, even if spme faces look a bit weird. I complained about how in the original RE playing as both characters wasn't worth it because the story barely changed, but that's completely fixed here. Not only do each of them have compelling and really different stories, but they also have different accessible rooms, gameplay segments and even final bosses. Another recurring problem with this franchise is that the best area is always the first one, and although that's also the case here, both the sewers and the lab are really fun and memorable in their own way.

I enjoyed the game a lot more, to the point where I was the one pushing us to do the DLC together, but it still didn't quite enamour me like I'd wanted it to. My main complaint at the time was the design of some of the bosses. I felt that a lot of them relied on being able to pay attention to cues and bullets coming from multiple parts of the screen, often with them all acting completely independently. I have a huge amount of trouble processing all of that information, so oftentimes I found bosses just far too overwhelming. Not a design issue or anything, more of a personal one.\"]",

         "I'd give this game a 4 for each individual aspect (platforming, exploration, combat) but the integration and packaging of the content are so good, it's slightly better that the sum of its parts. Most of the combat and traversal abilities feel useful, and many evoke that Super Metroid-y, gleeful feeling that you'll finally be able to access that new area, grab that item, or beat that boss. The end-game challenges, reminiscent of Wiley's fortress and boss rushes after Megaman has fully self-actualized, were the highlight. Boss rushes in particular were fun to dissect and master. I found uses for some charms I had written off as \"not my style\" to counter some of the unconventional boss mechanics. My only gripes:\n                     \n                     -The repeated backtracking. I get it - a fast-travel mechanic that's too liberal can erase the environment, but this was excessive.\n                     \n                     -Some of the charms seemed worthless, even after strategizing for boss, combat, and platforming rushes.\n                     \n                     -In the name of decency and civility, make geo-sucking ability automatic.",

In addition to blocks, the environment features plants, mobs, and items. Some activities in the game include mining for ore, fighting hostile mobs, and crafting new blocks and tools by gathering various resources found in the game.

         "I'd give this game a 4 for each individual aspect (platforming, exploration, combat) but the integration and packaging of the content are so good, it's slightly better that the sum of its parts. Most of the combat and traversal abilities feel useful, and many evoke that Super Metroid-y, gleeful feeling that you'll finally be able to access that new area, grab that item, or beat that boss. The end-game challenges, reminiscent of Wiley's fortress and boss rushes after Megaman has fully self-actualized, were the highlight. Boss rushes in particular were fun to dissect and master. I found uses for some charms I had written off as \"not my style\" to counter some of the unconventional boss mechanics. My only gripes:\n                     \n                     -The repeated backtracking. I get it - a fast-travel mechanic that's too liberal can erase the environment, but this was excessive.\n                     \n                     -Some of the charms seemed worthless, even after strategizing for boss, combat, and platforming rushes.\n                     \n                     -In the name of decency and civility, make geo-sucking ability automatic.",

In SMTIV at least, these were entirely optional and you had to purchase them. In Persona 5 Royal, they included the DLC, which again, I could ignore if they are optional, but I can't. Unlike in pervious games, there are legitimate fusions using legitimate personas that allow you to straight-up just get these P2W personas naturally, which I absolute fathom and throws the balance of the game out the window.\n                     \n                     -And more importantly, the entirety of Kasumi's character pre-third semester (I want to punch her)",

Cannot say I didn't like Persona 5 at all but this sort of infantile fleur around the characters and situations got me at last. I played some SMT games and they seemed much more sophisticated and thoughtful (especially the 4th). However, I cannot say that Persona 5 is a bad game, although my experience with it was a bit rough. I had this state of waiting for something, like 5-10 hours more, and something incredible would happen for sure, characters pull off some weird moves and the real Persona (the one everyone is so hyped up about) would begin...

         "I'd give this game a 4 for each individual aspect (platforming, exploration, combat) but the integration and packaging of the content are so good, it's slightly better that the sum of its parts. Most of the combat and traversal abilities feel useful, and many evoke that Super Metroid-y, gleeful feeling that you'll finally be able to access that new area, grab that item, or beat that boss. The end-game challenges, reminiscent of Wiley's fortress and boss rushes after Megaman has fully self-actualized, were the highlight. Boss rushes in particular were fun to dissect and master. I found uses for some charms I had written off as \"not my style\" to counter some of the unconventional boss mechanics. My only gripes:\n                     \n                     -The repeated backtracking.

In SMTIV at least, these were entirely optional and you had to purchase them. In Persona 5 Royal, they included the DLC, which again, I could ignore if they are optional, but I can't.

         "I'd give this game a 4 for each individual aspect (platforming, exploration, combat) but the integration and packaging of the content are so good, it's slightly better that the sum of its parts. Most of the combat and traversal abilities feel useful, and many evoke that Super Metroid-y, gleeful feeling that you'll finally be able to access that new area, grab that item, or beat that boss. The end-game challenges, reminiscent of Wiley's fortress and boss rushes after Megaman has fully self-actualized, were the highlight. Boss rushes in particular were fun to dissect and master. I found uses for some charms I had written off as \"not my style\" to counter some of the unconventional boss mechanics. My only gripes:\n                     \n                     -The repeated backtracking. I get it - a fast-travel mechanic that's too liberal can erase the environment, but this was excessive.\n                     \n                     -Some of the charms seemed worthless, even after strategizing for boss, combat, and platforming rushes.\n                     \n                     -In the name of decency and civility, make geo-sucking ability automatic."

I feel basil could definitely use some more screentime, the guy rarely gets any in the real world section of the game. The writing is pretty good too though I'm not a fan of the \"le quirky random indie game writing xdddd\" like this game has but there were times where it did make me chuckle."

In SMTIV at least, these were entirely optional and you had to purchase them. In Persona 5 Royal, they included the DLC, which again, I could ignore if they are optional, but I can't. Unlike in pervious games, there are legitimate fusions using legitimate personas that allow you to straight-up just get these P2W personas naturally, which I absolute fathom and throws the balance of the game out the window.\n                     \n                     -And more importantly, the entirety of Kasumi's character pre-third semester (I want to punch her)"

I had this state of waiting for something, like 5-10 hours more, and something incredible would happen for sure, characters pull off some weird moves and the real Persona (the one everyone is so hyped up about) would begin...

         "I'd give this game a 4 for each individual aspect (platforming, exploration, combat) but the integration and packaging of the content are so good, it's slightly better that the sum of its parts. Most of the combat and traversal abilities feel useful, and many evoke that Super Metroid-y, gleeful feeling that you'll finally be able to access that new area, grab that item, or beat that boss. The end-game challenges, reminiscent of Wiley's fortress and boss rushes after Megaman has fully self-actualized, were the highlight. Boss rushes in particular were fun to dissect and master. I found uses for some charms I had written off as \"not my style\" to counter some of the unconventional boss mechanics. My only gripes:\n                     \n                     -The repeated backtracking. I get it - a fast-travel mechanic that's too liberal can erase the environment, but this was excessive.\n                     \n                     -Some of the charms seemed worthless, even after strategizing for boss, combat, and platforming rushes.\n                     \n                     -In the name of decency and civility, make geo-sucking ability automatic.",

I feel basil could definitely use some more screentime, the guy rarely gets any in the real world section of the game.

In SMTIV at least, these were entirely optional and you had to purchase them. In Persona 5 Royal, they included the DLC, which again, I could ignore if they are optional, but I can't. Unlike in pervious games, there are legitimate fusions using legitimate personas that allow you to straight-up just get these P2W personas naturally, which I absolute fathom and throws the balance of the game out the window.\n                     \n                     -And more importantly, the entirety of Kasumi's character pre-third semester (I want to punch her)",

However, I cannot say that Persona 5 is a bad game, although my experience with it was a bit rough. I had this state of waiting for something, like 5-10 hours more, and something incredible would happen for sure, characters pull off some weird moves and the real Persona (the one everyone is so hyped up about) would begin...
